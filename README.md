TITLE:       	
PROJECT TITLE ANALYSIS AND PLAGIARISM DETECTION WITH THE HELP OF AI ML


INTRODUCTION:
Academic integrity and originality are fundamental pillars of quality research and project work. With the increasing volume of student projects and reports, manually verifying their uniqueness and readability becomes a tedious and error-prone task. To address this challenge, we propose an AI-driven system that automates plagiarism detection, similarity analysis, and readability assessment for academic project reports.
This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to compare an uploaded report against a database of previous submissions. The system identifies the most similar report (along with student and guide details), computes a readability score, and evaluates the uniqueness of the content.
Problem Statement 
In academic environments, students often submit project reports that may contain unintentional or deliberate plagiarism from previous works, making it challenging for educators to manually verify originality and assess readability. Existing plagiarism detection tools are either too generic (focused on web sources) or lack domain-specific analysis for academic reports, leading to inefficiencies in evaluating uniqueness and content quality. This project addresses these gaps by developing an AI-powered system that automatically compares uploaded reports against a curated database of past submissions, identifies the most similar works, evaluates readability, and quantifies uniqueness—ensuring fair assessment while reducing manual effort.

OBJECTIVES
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. 	Plagiarism Detection:
o   Identify textual similarities between the uploaded report and existing reports in the database.
o   Detect direct copying, paraphrased content, and structural similarities.
2. 	Similarity Analysis & Matching:
o   Rank previous reports based on similarity scores.
o   Display the most matched report along with student and guide details.
3. 	Readability Assessment:
o   Evaluate the report’s language complexity using NLP-based metrics.
4. 	Uniqueness Scoring:
o   Generate a uniqueness percentage to quantify originality.
o   Highlight sections with high overlap for further review.
5. 	User-Friendly Reporting:
o   Present results in an interpretable dashboard for educators/students.
o   Allow downloadable similarity and readability reports.
 
 
Scope:
The system is designed to:
 * Analyze academic project reports (PDF/DOCX formats) in a given domain.
 * Compare content only against a preloaded database (not web sources).
 * Support English-language text analysis.
 * Serve educators and students for fair evaluation and self-improvement.

 Methodological Details:

1. Designing and Developing the Project System
a. Data Collection & Preprocessing
·Dataset: Curated database of past project reports (PDF/DOCX) with metadata (student name, guide, year).
·Text Extraction: Use tools like PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or Apache Tika to extract raw text.
·Cleaning: Remove headers/footers, special characters, and normalize whitespace.
b. Feature Engineering
·Text Vectorization: Convert text to numerical features using:
oTF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for keyword-based similarity.
oWord Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) for semantic analysis.
·Metadata Integration: Include project titles, guide names, and year for contextual matching.
c. Plagiarism Detection Pipeline
·Similarity Algorithms:
o   Cosine Similarity (TF-IDF vectors) to quantify text overlap.
o   Jaccard Index for n-gram comparisons.
oBERT-based models (e.g., Sentence-BERT) for paraphrased content detection.
·Thresholding: Flag reports with similarity scores > 15% (configurable).
d. Readability & Uniqueness Analysis
·        Readability Metrics:
o   Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index (using textstat library).
·        Uniqueness Score:
o   Uniqueness = 100% − (Highest Similarity Score).
e. System Architecture
·        Frontend: Streamlit/Flask for report uploads and results visualization.
·        Backend: Python (NLTK, scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers).
·        Database: JSON.
2. Deploying the Project
a. Local Deployment (Testing Phase)
·        Environment Setup:
o   Python 3.8+ with dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt).
o   Configure database paths and model weights.
·        Execution:
o   Run the Streamlit/Flask app locally (streamlit run app.py).
o   Test with sample reports and validate accuracy.
b. Cloud Deployment (Scalable Solution)
·        Platform: AWS/GCP/Azure (e.g., EC2 instance + S3 bucket for reports).
·        Containerization: Dockerize the app for portability.
·        API Integration: FastAPI to expose plagiarism detection as a REST API.
c. User Workflow
1. 	Upload: User submits a project report via the web interface.
2. 	Processing: System runs plagiarism checks and readability analysis.
3. 	Output: Displays:
o   Most similar report (student/guide details).
o   Readability score (e.g., "Grade 12 Level").
o   Uniqueness percentage (e.g., "85% Original").
d. Maintenance & Updates
·        Database Expansion: Periodic addition of new reports.
·        Model Retraining: Fine-tune BERT models with domain-specific data.
